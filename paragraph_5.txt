 VALLABHBHAI, Herewith a statement of my views 1 about the Constituent Assembly. Please go through it and do what you think fit. Jawaharlals absence will be a handicap. I hold very strong views in the matter. There is certainly no weakness on our part in giving up the plan. Doing what the situation demands is no weakness. But maybe I am quite wrong.
