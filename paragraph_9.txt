 DEAR SIR, With reference to your letter of 2nd inst., since the Oxford University Press is not conducted for profit, I should think that a net profit being stipulated for, there should be no objection to a minimum profit. The only inducement to the Navajivan Trust, and for that matter also for me, to have a well known concern like yours publishing Shri R. K. Prabhus compilation can be to acquire the widest publicity possible outside India for it. The Navajivan Press exists only for printing writings like Shri Prabhus compilation as cheaply as possible for Indian readers. The object therefore undoubtedly is to publish an edition as cheap as possible and certainly cheaper than yours. Therefore it would be improper to hold over publication of such an Indian edition till your stock is exhausted. If you rely chiefly on Indian sales, I think the contemplated publication by you might be dropped. Labours of the authors will not go unrewarded in any case. I will ask the Navajivan Trust to cover them and publish their compilation whenever they are in a position to do so.
